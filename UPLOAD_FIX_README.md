# Upload Feature Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem Description

The upload feature was working fine on localhost but failing on the deployed Vercel site with a **413 Payload Too Large** error. This happens because:

1. **Vercel has a default payload size limit of 4.5MB** for serverless functions
2. **The server wasn't configured with proper file size limits**
3. **Missing error handling for file size validation**

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Server Configuration (`server/server.js`)

- Added `express.json({ limit: '10mb' })` and `express.urlencoded({ limit: '10mb', extended: true })`
- Added proper error handling middleware for multer errors
- Added multer import for error handling

### 2. Multer Configuration (`server/middlewares/multer.js`)

- Added file size limit: **10MB maximum**
- Added file type validation
- Added file count limit: **1 file only**
- Better error handling for upload failures

### 3. Frontend Validation (`src/pages/Upload.js`)

- Added client-side file size validation (10MB limit)
- Added file type validation
- Better error messages for users
- Prevents users from attempting to upload files that are too large

### 4. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

- Added function configuration with `maxDuration: 30` seconds
- This allows more time for larger file uploads

## File Size Limits

- **Server-side limit**: 10MB
- **Client-side validation**: 10MB
- **Vercel default**: 4.5MB (overridden by our configuration)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix upload feature for Vercel deployment - add file size limits and validation"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

The changes will automatically deploy if you have Vercel connected to your repository.

### 3. Verify Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in your Vercel dashboard:

- `MONGO_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Your Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Your Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Your Cloudinary API secret

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Small Files (< 4.5MB)

- Upload should work normally through the standard endpoint

### 2. Test Medium Files (4.5MB - 10MB)

- Upload should work through the server with our new limits

### 3. Test Large Files (> 10MB)

- Client-side validation should prevent upload attempt
- Clear error message should be shown

## Error Messages

### File Too Large

```
File size must be less than 10.0MB. Your file is X.XMB.
```

### Invalid File Type

```
Invalid file type. Only images and videos are allowed.
```

### Server Errors

- 413: File too large (handled gracefully)
- 400: Invalid file type or other validation errors
- 500: Server errors (logged and handled)

## Fallback Mechanism

The system still includes the fallback to direct Cloudinary upload for very large files, but now users won't encounter the 413 error because of the client-side validation.

## Monitoring

Check your Vercel function logs to monitor:

- Upload success rates
- File size distribution
- Any remaining errors

## Future Improvements

1. **Progressive uploads** for very large files
2. **File compression** before upload
3. **Chunked uploads** for videos
4. **Upload progress indicators**

## Troubleshooting

### If uploads still fail:

1. Check Vercel function logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check if file size is actually under 10MB
4. Verify Cloudinary credentials are working

### If you need larger file support:

1. Consider using Vercel's Edge Functions (higher limits)
2. Implement direct-to-Cloudinary uploads for all files
3. Use a different hosting service with higher limits
