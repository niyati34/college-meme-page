# Fix for "No memes found" Error

## Problem Description
The application was showing "No memes found" error even when memes existed in the database. This was caused by several issues:

1. **Missing fields in Meme model**: The controller was trying to access fields like `categories`, `tags`, `dislikes`, `shares`, and `status` that didn't exist in the model.
2. **API parameter handling**: The `fetchMemes` function wasn't properly passing query parameters to the backend.
3. **Environment variable mismatch**: Frontend was using `REACT_APP_API_URL` but API was using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Meme Model (`server/models/Meme.js`)
- Added missing fields: `categories`, `tags`, `dislikes`, `shares`, `status`, `trendingScore`
- Enhanced trending score calculation method
- Added proper validation and defaults

### 2. Fixed API Function (`src/api/index.js`)
- Updated `fetchMemes` to properly handle query parameters
- Fixed environment variable name from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to `REACT_APP_API_URL`

### 3. Added Sample Data Script (`server/createSampleMemes.js`)
- Script to create sample memes for testing
- Creates 5 sample memes with different categories
- Automatically calculates trending scores

### 4. Added Development Scripts
- `npm run server`: Start backend server only
- `npm run dev`: Start both frontend and backend simultaneously
- `npm run create-samples`: Create sample memes in database

## How to Test the Fix

### Prerequisites
1. MongoDB running locally or accessible via connection string
2. Node.js and npm installed

### Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/college-memes
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Steps to Test
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd server && npm install
   ```

2. **Create sample data**:
   ```bash
   npm run create-samples
   ```

3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 5000)

4. **Verify memes are displayed**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - You should see 5 sample memes displayed
   - Test filters and search functionality

## Expected Results
- Memes should load and display properly
- No more "No memes found" error
- Filters and search should work correctly
- Trending memes should appear at the top

## Troubleshooting
If you still see issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Check if backend server is running on port 5000
4. Ensure sample data was created successfully

## Files Modified
- `server/models/Meme.js` - Updated model schema
- `src/api/index.js` - Fixed API function
- `server/createSampleMemes.js` - New sample data script
- `package.json` - Added development scripts
- `server/package.json` - Added sample creation script
